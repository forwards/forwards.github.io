The first girls R coding workshop was held at the Kathleen Symes library in Melbourne, Nov Oct 28, 2017. The girls learned about tidy data concepts, wrangling data tools, and built a shiny app to explore standardised test data from the 2015 OECD Programme for International Student Achievement. One of the apps developed can be viewed at [https://t.co/zlw3HGzOaR](https://t.co/zlw3HGzOaR).

And we had lamingtons, upside down R cupcakes (R downunder) for morning tea, and pizzas for lunch.
