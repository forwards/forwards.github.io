      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/&#34;&gt;first post on the useR! 2016 survey&lt;/a&gt; we discussed the responses from the demographic section, finding in particular that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The useR! 2016 attendees were predominately men, typically under 40, White/Caucasian and employed full-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women attendees tended to be younger and less advanced in their careers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Asian minority races and LGBT individuals were under-represented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately a quarter of attendees were caregivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now turn to look at useRs relationship with R: what experience do they have in using R and what do they think of R?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useR! attendees have generally been using R for many years and often have prior programming experience. Women tend to have less experience and a lower involvement in package development, though this can be attributed to a lower age distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women are less likely to use R for recreation, but are just as likely as men to consider writing R fun. useR! attendees have a generally positive view of R and would recommend it to friends and colleagues for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend teaching R to newcomers in a way that focuses on data science and does not assume a programming background. Mentors and managers should recognize that people from under-represented groups may need additional support to fill in gaps in their programming knowledge. To encourage people from under-represented groups to develop as R programmers and contribute to the community, we recommend promoting opportunities and activities that are paid and/or help to advance their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;survey-results&#34;&gt;Survey results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming-experience&#34;&gt;Programming experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first asked attendees how long they had been using R for. Unsurprisingly for
attendees of a conference all about R, the respondents tend to be rather experienced, with more than half (57%, 251 of 442) using R for at least 5 years. Nonetheless, the conference does attract people new to R, with a small number having less than 6 months experience. A greater proportion of women than men have fewer than two years experience (24%, 39 of 164 vs 12%, 34 of 276) which correlates with the younger age distribution we noted in our first post. The following plot shows the percentages within each experience category for each gender:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;66% of women (109 of 165) said they had programming experience before learning to use R, compared with 82% of men (227 of 276). Since women tend to be younger, this could be due to increasing use of R in teaching, particularly on undergraduate courses. Thus younger people generally are less likely to have used other languages for data analysis such as SAS, Stata, S-plus, Genstat, etc. However it could indicate a different background of women vs. men, in particular they may be less likely to have any formal training in computer science, where they might have been taught C/C++, Java etc before learning R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also asked about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; people use the language. Respondents were asked to confirm that any or all of the following statements applied to them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I use functions from existing R packages to analyze data&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I write R code designed to make my work easier, such as loops or conditionals or functions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I write R functions for use by myself or my collaborators&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I contribute to R packages (on CRAN or elsewhere)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have written my own R package&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have written my own R package and released it on CRAN or Bioconductor (or shared it on GitHub, R-Forge or similar platforms)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As might be expected given the length of time useR! attendees have been using R, their use is generally quite advanced with the vast majority using techniques to control the flow of their code (86%, 392 of 458) or writing custom R functions (85%, 389 of 458). More than half have written their own package(s) (52%, 238 of 458) and a third have publicly released a package (34%, 155 of 458).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the distribution of length of R programming experience, the proportion of women using advanced programming techniques is slightly lower than men and when it comes to package development the proportion is lower still:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final question we asked regarding use of R was whether the attendees use R primarily for work, recreation or both. The results were significantly different for men and women, only 22% of women (35 of 162) use R for both work and recreation compared to 45% of men (147 of 275); the few people that use R for recreation only were all men. Although factors such as age and programming experience may come into play here, it is likely that social expectations of women are also a factor. For example, although responsibility for cooking, childcare and housework is shared more evenly among working couples, in different sex couples women often shoulder a greater responsibility&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. With reduced leisure time, women may be less willing to use R just for fun, or may feel less able to do so, due to expectations of their family and friends about how they should spend their free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this paints a picture of useR! attendees as a population of mostly long-term R programmers often writing code for more than their individual use - which makes sense. As we discussed in our first post, conferences are expensive in terms of both time and money, so a conference on R is most viable for people that use R substantially in their work and hence can justify the cost to their employers. As the main conference organised by the R Foundation, useR! is particularly attractive to dedicated contributors to the R project, indeed talks and posters should present a contribution which will often be a new package or contribution to a package. This goes some way to explaining some of the inequalities in attendee demographics; we know from separate research (albeit using a rather crude metric) that CRAN maintainers, for example, are mostly not women.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that the women that do attend useR! tend to be younger and less experienced. We have not explored the programming experience of other under-represented groups, for example with regard to ethnicity or sexual orientation, as the numbers in the sample are much lower, prohibiting reliable statistical conclusions and creating issues with identifiability. It is possible that, like women, members of other under-represented groups are also less likely to use R for recreation, as they will tend to have less time or money than is the norm.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This indicates a barrier to women and other under-represented groups transitioning from useRs to developeRs: package authorship and maintenance, and dedication to an open source community, is largely uncompensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opinions-about-r&#34;&gt;Opinions about R&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of our section on R programming asked respondents for their opinions on R. On these questions there were no significant differences between the responses from men and women, so we present the results for all respondents, including non-binary individuals and those that did not declare their gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first asked respondents how strongly they agreed or disagreed with the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing R is fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing R is considered cool or interesting by my peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing R is a monotonous task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing R is difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are presented below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that respondents overwhelmingly agree that writing R is fun, so even those people that use R primarily for work enjoy doing so. The view of their peers is slightly less positive, with 12%
(51 of 438) stating that writing R is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; considered cool or interesting by their peers and 15% having no opinion on this (65 of 438). Even among those who agreed with the second statement, the proportion that strongly agreed is lower compared to the first statement. So although the overall picture is positive, there is a sizable group for which writing R is not encouraged by their peers, which could affect their motivation to contribute, particularly outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority (61%, 269 of 438) disagree with the statement that writing R is difficult. Those that agreed with this statement are spread across the experience levels, so some may have been expressing a general opinion about R programming rather than a personal one, necessarily. The disagreement is stronger (80%, 349 of 438) against the statement that writing R is a monotonous task, so while writing R may occasionally be difficult most useR! attendees find it challenging and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generally positive view of R among useR! attendees is not so surprising, after all most will have chosen to attend the conference, or if it was required by their work they have expressed an interest in R by applying for that job or choosing to use R at work in the first place. Nonetheless, the positive view is a benefit to the community as useRs encourage people to take up R and contribute more to the R project, with many useRs being in a position to teach R, mentor junior colleagues/students or contribute to community events such as R user groups or R-ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;91% (418 of 439) said that they would recommend R to friends and colleagues. The reasons some people would not recommend R include a steep learning curve, too many idiosyncrasies, poor performance and that it encourages bad programming practice. Some simply said they would recommend other software over R or they may recommend R, depending on why their friend or colleague wanted to learn a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked to pick a single reason for recommending R, nearly 40% (160 of 425) said it was good for statistical analysis. R has long been described as the lingua franca of statistics or data science, so this makes sense. The next biggest reason was that it was good for reproducible research, indicating the increasing importance that has been put on this topic in recent years. Other important features are the package ecosystem, strength at visualization and the fact that it is free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-forward&#34;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;outreach-to-under-represented-groups&#34;&gt;Outreach to under-represented groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the R community seeks to be more inclusive of under-represented groups we need to be aware that individuals from these groups are less likely to have a programming background and may have less freedom to spend time on unpaid and recreational contributions. Given R&amp;rsquo;s strength as a tool for statistical analysis, introductions to R should focus on this rather than the nuts and bolts of the language, as a general rule. More experienced R programmers from under-represented groups may need additional support to transition to developeRs &amp;ndash; even when writing packages in pure R, concepts such as version control and object-oriented programming may be new and of course interfacing with other languages such as C++ is a further stretch. We should seek to promote opportunities to under-represented groups that are paid and/or will benefit their career, e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4947241283354624/&#34;&gt;Google Summer of Code projects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://user2017.brussels/diversity-scholarships&#34;&gt;useR! diversity scholarships&lt;/a&gt;, professional development via &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org/&#34;&gt;R-ladies groups&lt;/a&gt;, developing a package with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org/community/&#34;&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt;, publishing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://journal.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;The R Journal&lt;/a&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;taskforce-initiatives&#34;&gt;Taskforce initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following our recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/call-to-join-forwards/&#34;&gt;call to join Forwards&lt;/a&gt; we have set up a number of sub-teams to support women and other under-represented groups in the R community. In particular the teaching team will focus on more inclusive pedagogy, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/forwards/teaching_examples&#34;&gt;using examples to engage a wider demographic&lt;/a&gt;, and running workshops for women and girls. We have also set up a community team, to look at ways to reach out to under-represented groups and an on-ramps team to look at ways to help useRs transition to developeRs. These are all new initiatives, but we hope to get some projects off the ground in all these areas in the coming year. Anyone wishing to get involved can contact us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:rowforwards@gmail.com&#34;&gt;rowforwards@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;further-research&#34;&gt;Further research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting questions for further research on useRs relationship with R include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What programming experience do people have before using R? For example, what languages did people learn before R?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do people write packages but not publicly release them? For example, are the packages for their own use (work/recreation), for internal company use, or are the packages in development? One respondent commented that their employer prohibited releasing packages on CRAN; how widespread is this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the pros and cons of using R? Several respondents commented that R has many benefits but also some drawbacks and richer data could be collected on this topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not plan to release the raw survey data as many individuals can be uniquely identified from one or two demographic questions. We may release the data in an aggregated form once we have completed our full analysis (this post covers the second of three sections).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis presented here used the following packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For data manipulation: dplyr, forcats, purrr, tidyr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For visualization and reporting: knitr, ggplot2, likert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/forwards/surveys-public/blog-posts/useR-2016/users-relationship-with-r/users-relationship-with-r.Rmd&#34;&gt;Rmarkdown file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banner image was based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MorphoFun/status/831668445032873985&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plotHeart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function written by Sandy Kawano for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, based on this &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/6546778/173755&#34;&gt;answer to a Stackoverflow post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;For example, average earnings in the US are lower for many ethnic minorities in general and in science and engineering occupations in particular, including computer and information science specifically (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab9-17.pdf&#34;&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab9-17.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). The  American Association of University Women report that gay and bisexual men tend to be paid less than similarly qualified heterosexual men; while trans women (who have transitioned from male to female) experience a drop in pay. They also report that transgender people frequently face harassment and discrimination; this may affect their motivation for voluntary contribution (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aauw.org/resource/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/&#34;&gt;http://www.aauw.org/resource/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Emily Robinson, from Social Scientist to Data Scientist</title>
      <link>//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/02/07/emily-robinson-from-social-scientist-to-data-scientist/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2017 19:26:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/02/07/emily-robinson-from-social-scientist-to-data-scientist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maëlle Salmon, a Forwards collaborator, got the chance to interview Emily Robinson, who recently became a data analyst at Etsy. A very inspiring R-Lady!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi, Emily! Thanks for letting us interview you! You studied  Decision Sciences at Rice University and then graduated from INSEAD with a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). What are those fields? How do they help you today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision Sciences was an interdisciplinary major I actually created at Rice in my sophomore year based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/&#34;&gt;Carnegie Mellon’s major&lt;/a&gt;. Before then I&amp;rsquo;d been planning to major in economics or psychology, but I found that neither really satisfied what I was looking for: to understand how people make decisions. So I decided to take the rarely used option at Rice to design my own curriculum with the input of many faculty members, and I created a course list that was a mix of economics, psychology, statistics, and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational Behavior is a pretty broad field, but essentially is the application of sociology and psychology applied to organizations/work. So people study everything from the effect of power on behavior to the benefits and pitfalls of multicultural teams to how social activists affect corporate political activity. I focused more on the micro (psychology) side and studied women in STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the statistics courses I took have definitely helped. Also, the data science project process is actually quite similar to social sciences research: you come up with a question or a hypothesis, gather and clean the data, run an analysis, and communicate your findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think there&amp;rsquo;s often a place for knowledge about human and organizational behavior to come into the data science research process. I talked a lot in my interviews about how social sciences knowledge could be used in designing experiments; for example, the fact that giving people more choices actually makes them less likely to buy something, or that people from different countries use satisfaction scales differently (e.g. an American and a German may be equally satisfied with a product, but because of cultural reasons the German gives a lower score on a scale out of 10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You then decided to become a data scientist instead. What motivated this decision? (Also, note we now assume you make decisions in a smarter way than most of us, given the name of your college major!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short answer: I felt data science was where the most interesting questions, tools, and data were. I also believe that working as a data scientist/analyst offers a bigger possibility for broad impact than academia. While there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a lot of interesting and important research being done in academia, it&amp;rsquo;s a very long, slow process, with a lot of luck, and often times doesn&amp;rsquo;t reach anyone outside of the ivory tower.  If anyone wants the longer story, please feel free to reach out to me on twitter/email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When did you first come in contact with R? Was it love at first sight? From which point did you feel enough at ease to be not only a R user, but also a R programmer?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very lucky to do my undergraduate degree at Rice University, where at the time Hadley Wickham was a Statistics Professor. I only took one course with him, an Introduction to Statistics course, which didn&amp;rsquo;t involve R, but he had also designed later courses that were taught by his graduate students. At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how prominent in the R community he was, despite my brother Dave Robinson (then a PhD student at Princeton, now a data scientist at StackOverflow) shouting at me how cool it was that I was being taught by Hadley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the courses were so well-designed and taught, I definitely fell in love with R at first sight. Despite its reputation as having a steep learning curve, I found it fairly straight forward to pick up (or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just romanticizing it in my memories). That being said, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it much outside of my statistics courses that required it, except to make a few plots for one of my research projects. It was in graduate school that I started to use R of my own volition. As I wrote about in one of my blog posts, I got so frustrated with using STATA, the language of choice for my graduate program, for certain class assignments that I switched to using R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this transition from being an R user to R programmer was also helped by some new tidyverse packages that came out in the last few years, especially dplyr. While the packages I initially learned, like reshape2 and plyr, were great, R has clearly advanced in the four years since I did most of my R courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is this program you&amp;rsquo;ve done for transitioning into your new career and how did you hear about it? How much can one learn in 12 weeks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metis is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps&#34;&gt;Data Science Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; that helps people transition into careers as a Data Scientist/Analyst. I heard about it from my brother, who had spoken at Metis and gone to their career day, where students present their final projects to recruiters and data scientists. He had been really impressed by the quality of the students and their work, and so I looked into the program more. I found that it fit perfectly my background, as what I was missing was Python skills and Machine Learning knowledge. Metis is not meant to take you from 0 to 60; everyone who enters the program has some knowledge of statistics and programming, although their backgrounds still vary widely. In my cohort, we had people a few years out of college, one person with twenty years of marketing experience, and a few with PhDs in quantitative fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/02/07/emily-robinson-from-social-scientist-to-data-scientist/metis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily’s Metis cohort plus the two instructors (two people on the right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what you can learn in 12 weeks, Metis is not meant to make you an expert in everything they cover. Rather, by giving you exposure to many topics and having you do projects around them, you get a good enough grounding so that you can continue learning on your own. It also gives you a portfolio of projects that you can host on your GitHub and talk about during interviews. The other big benefit is the career support from the Metis career team and from the extensive alumni network. You receive help in making a resume and prepping for interviews, but also in connecting you to people at the companies you&amp;rsquo;re interested in. For me it was 100% worth it. It was also a lot of fun and I met some great people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You had to use Python at Metis: Which language do you use the most now? Could you use only Python?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I just started my position, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which language I&amp;rsquo;ll be using more. Etsy is pretty agnostic for which language its analysts use, and a lot of the work is done in SQL since we are working with such big datasets. If I had too, I could definitely use only Python, since I did use it so intensely for those few months. But I&amp;rsquo;m still definitely biased towards R and will probably be using that more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have just started a job at Etsy as a data scientist (congrats!). Could you tell us a little bit more about your job there? What kind of problems do you solve? How is the work organized between members of your team?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you! My official title is actually Data Analyst and I&amp;rsquo;m on the analytics team; Data Scientists at Etsy are on the engineering (production) side and generally have PhDs in Computer Science/Machine Learning or similar backgrounds. While the analytics team sits together, we are embedded with other teams and serve as a sort of consultant, helping those teams improve how they use and analyze their data, run experiments, etc. For example, we have analysts working with marketing, accounting, seller services, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on search, which I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about since search is such a big part of the Etsy experience. Etsy actually just acquired BlackBird Technologies and their team to bring AI into their search, which should offer a lot of new opportunities. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working closely with another senior analyst and the broader search sciences team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all being said, Etsy does a great job with orientation and the first few weeks are dedicated to meeting people, reading analytics on-boarding materials, and getting my tech stack set up. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anything yet about what specific projects I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on and won&amp;rsquo;t for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you wish to have known sooner on your way to become a data scientist?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be intimidated! It&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel like unless you have a PhD in Machine Learning and are an expert in Big Data that there are no roles for you. This isn&amp;rsquo;t helped by the fact that some companies&amp;rsquo; job postings read like a wish list for a Data Scientist unicorn. But if you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on building your skills, you can find a position for you. You also DO NOT need to necessarily meet all of the job requirements; don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to apply to a job where you&amp;rsquo;re just missing one of multiple criteria, or you have a year or two fewer years of experience than they mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as with almost every job, networking is critical. At some companies, there are thousands of people applying for each position, and having someone refer you can really help you get your foot in the door. Even more than that, talking to someone about the culture and day-to-day work in a company will really help you in your interview, because you&amp;rsquo;ll know more about what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for and if you&amp;rsquo;re a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, don&amp;rsquo;t be hung up on titles and only focus on positions where the title is &amp;ldquo;Data Scientist&amp;rdquo;. The work you&amp;rsquo;re doing is what&amp;rsquo;s important, and some data analysts are doing work that at other companies would be classified as a data scientist job. My title is a Data Analyst (as was Hilary Parker&amp;rsquo;s when she started out at Etsy), and while I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be doing deep learning projects anytime soon, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s going to be any shortage of interesting and challenging work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You mention the importance of giving back to the open-source community on your blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsones.github.io/&#34;&gt;Hooked on Data&lt;/a&gt;. What are your plans with the blog and your programming in general? (Please keep writing on your blog!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big thing I want to do is host some in-person R tutorials for the R-Ladies NYC group. They had their kick-off meeting a few weeks ago, and many people expressed interest in an introduction to R tutorial and a more advanced one. While there are definitely some good resources online, my favorites are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datacamp.com/&#34;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt; for interactive tutorials and Hadley and Garrett&amp;rsquo;s new &lt;a href=&#34;http://r4ds.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/a&gt; book, I do think it can sometimes be easier to learn in person. I tried to get more people in my graduate program (including professors!) to use R, so I&amp;rsquo;d love to help a group that already recognizes the value of R and is eager to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I definitely want to keep blogging. I think a lot of my work at Etsy is going to be confidential, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to share that, but hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to talk about some cool side projects I&amp;rsquo;m doing or general principles I learned from my work. I&amp;rsquo;ve promised posts about making my first R package and my final Metis project, so I&amp;rsquo;d better get going on those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. DataCamp has a few free courses, but if anyone wants to try unlimited access you can do so for free for two days with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datacamp.com/invite/llm1rCA6gyetm&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s some really great courses, including one by Hadley and his sister Charlotte, and another by my brother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last but not least, we were thrilled to learn you are a RCatLady although you don&amp;rsquo;t have a cat! Also you have a dog! Is she a good R-Dog?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/02/07/emily-robinson-from-social-scientist-to-data-scientist/dog2.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily&amp;rsquo;s R-Dog Abby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is the best R-Dog. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited that Etsy is a dog-friendly office, and I plan to take her into the office sometime soon. I&amp;rsquo;m sure she&amp;rsquo;ll be very well-behaved; she spends most days sleeping on her bed or sitting under my mom&amp;rsquo;s desk at home right by her feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay now we are very jealous! Thanks again Emily for talking with us, all the best for the future!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact Emily via her &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:robinson.es@gmail.com&#34;&gt;email address&lt;/a&gt;, go read her &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsones.github.io/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, follow her on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/robinson_es&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robinsones&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinsones&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The views expressed in this interview represent Emily&amp;rsquo;s own views and opinions, not necessarily those of Etsy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forwards, the R Foundation taskforce on women and other under-represented
groups, is seeking to address issues affecting under-represented groups
in general as it works to broaden the participation of women in the R
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to adequately address such issues, we would like to widen the
diversity of the taskforce itself. Accordingly, we are inviting people who are part of under-represented groups - be they groups identified by race, gender, sexuality, class or disability - to join us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taskforce has teleconferences once every two months, although as the
taskforce is spread globally it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible for all members to attend
every time. Therefore online communication is also important and there are
occasional meetings within subteams. Subteams work on specific tasks, such
as data collection and analysis, social media, or working on recommendations
for R Foundation supported activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To express your interest or ask for further information, contact us at
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:rowforwards@gmail.com&#34;&gt;rowforwards@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; by 31 January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping useRs</title>
      <link>//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every year, hundreds of R programmers descend on a host city and spend three or four days sharing work, collaborating on projects and making new contacts - the useR! conference, this year held in Stanford, CA. useR! offers a wonderful opportunity to map a subset of the language&amp;rsquo;s most active users and the Women in R Task Force took this opportunity to survey attendees and find out their backgrounds, experiences and interests, in the hope that it will help us to get a better understanding of how to make the R community a more inclusive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our survey received 455 responses, out of 899 attendees, and appears to represent the attendees pretty accurately.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll step through the attendees&amp;rsquo; demographic background, how that represents the wider scientific and computing communities (and wider world), and propose recommendations for ways to bring these demographics towards parity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey responses showed that attendees were largely male and white, with Latinx, Native American and people of African descent particularly under-represented. Attendees were almost all employed, and what&amp;rsquo;s more, employed in a permanent, full-time job. Attendence skewed heavily towards people in their late 20s and early to mid 30s, with men tending to be older than women, and attendees largely coming from the United States and almost exclusively from North American and Western European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recommendations are that, going forward, useR! conferences set aside tickets and funding for under-represented groups, and put resources into facilities such as feeding rooms and childcare that would benefit caregivers with small children, many of whom are women. Additionally, the Task Force itself will be refocusing its efforts and mission to emphasise the intersectional nature of marginalisation that women face, in line with the dispiriting results around race, employment and educational attainment. We will also be running further surveys to build up a better idea of the &amp;ldquo;ground truth&amp;rdquo; of the R community, and to track improvements and suggestions on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;survey-results&#34;&gt;Survey results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gender-and-race&#34;&gt;Gender and race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender breakdown of responses (&lt;em&gt;n=453&lt;/em&gt;) showed that approximately &lt;em&gt;33%&lt;/em&gt; of attendees identified as women, with the majority of the remainder identifying as men and a small number identifying outside the gender binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the inclusion of women is not as bad as at other conferences, it&amp;rsquo;s also definitely &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; than it could be given that there are many scientific fields - such as biology, which R is particularly commonly used in - where women outnumber men in terms of degree attainment.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At the same time, some of this may be offset by the location and chosen topics for presentations, which were more focused on visualisation or computing than biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race is more complicated, because there&amp;rsquo;s more variation in the answers - as intended! Both race and gender questions were offered as a free text field to avoid restricting respondents to false dichotomies. One side-effect, though, is that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to aggregate the data. What we can say, though, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;74%&lt;/span&gt; of respondents identified as White or Caucasian;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;16%&lt;/span&gt; fell within the US Federal guidelines for &amp;lsquo;Asian&amp;rsquo;, or identified directly as Asian;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;3%&lt;/span&gt; identified as Hispanic or Latinx;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;1%&lt;/span&gt; identified as people of African descent;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;0.5%&lt;/span&gt; identified as Native American or Pacific Islander;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;0.25%&lt;/span&gt; identified as Middle Eastern and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0c2c84; font-weight:bolder&#34;&gt;3%&lt;/span&gt; identified as mixed-race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a survey of STEM workers in the United States found 6% were Black and 7% Hispanic&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - and the overall demographics of the United States point even more clearly to an under-representation of non-Asian minority groups.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The response rate was somewhat lower on this question (n = 409), perhaps due to concerns about identifiability. Nonetheless, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lgbt&#34;&gt;LGBT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5% of respondents identified as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Transgender. How this maps to overall industry, academic and population trends is hard to identify, because the long history of persecution of LGBT individuals and the often confusing and ill-defined nature of identity means that the proportion of LGBT individuals is regularly under-reported. Attempts to control for that under-reporting have shown up to 19% of the U.S. population experience same-sex attraction,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although more traditional methodologies suggest around 11%.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the useR! survey is one of the surveys in which under-reporting is found - although 447 responses were received, which suggests people at least didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;skip&lt;/em&gt; it - but it&amp;rsquo;s probably fair to say that such a sizeable difference in outcome is going to contain some genuine differences in population, as well as methodological variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is probable that the other demographics of LGBT attendees reflect the overall demographics of attendees, meaning that (for example) we would expect to find lesbians or bisexual women under-represented in that 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;age&#34;&gt;Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximating age (by subtracting the year of birth from 2016) shows the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women trend younger than men at the conference, but the age distribution is similar across the two genders; &lt;em&gt;47%&lt;/em&gt; of respondents (n = 438) were born in the 1980s - in other words, were people in their late 20s to mid 30s. This lines up neatly with the education data (more on that later) and suggests that people in their early 20s and 40+ year olds are not finding the conference appealing - because there are other things to spend time on, because money is tighter, or for some other reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women-being-younger element suggests that the rise in women attending (compared to 2015, where the proportion of women was only 19%) represents younger or newer members of the community attending, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R community is a highly international one, with developers in a wide range of countries. One of the things we were interested to discover is how this comes out in the attendee mix at useR!. Accordingly, we asked attendees which country they currently resided in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, R programmers from 34 nations attended useR!, but the overwhelming majority of respondents (&lt;em&gt;71%&lt;/em&gt; of n = 443) live in the United States. In some ways this isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising - the cost of getting to Stanford increases the further away you are, and it&amp;rsquo;s expensive to start with! - and the rotation of the conference between continents each year means that many non-US R programmers are likely to simply attend the next European event. At the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s still somewhat disappointing for an event considered the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; R conference, particularly with only ~20 attendees coming from Canada, a country bordering the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;education&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of attendees (&amp;gt;85%, of n = 451) had &lt;em&gt;completed&lt;/em&gt; postgraduate degrees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Highest Qualification Completed&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Women (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Men (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Professional degree or certification&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;1.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;2.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Doctorate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;41.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;45.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Masters degree&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;42.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;40.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Undergraduate degree&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;13.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;10.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;High school/Secondary school or lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This further suggests, on top of the data around age, that the conference is not attracting younger and more-early-career R programmers and researchers. Part of this may simply be that spending money on an R conference may be a lot easier to justify when you&amp;rsquo;re in full-time employment, or in a postgraduate degree with a stipend, than as an undergraduate or masters student; part of it is probably also that people without degrees, or without postgraduate degrees, earn less money and may come from poorer backgrounds, extending the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is worth noting that the concept of research conferences as places to attend is not something particularly pushed on undergraduates, and so there is a component of awareness as well as finance. Finally, it may simply be that the conference is very academia-oriented, and so is particularly attractive to academics (and those familiar with academia) rather than R programmers without an academic background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the age data suggests, women tend to be slightly earlier on in the traditional academic career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;professional-environment&#34;&gt;Professional environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the attendees were employed, which (with the cost of the tickets) makes sense. More interestingly, a majority of the attendees (&lt;em&gt;~57%&lt;/em&gt; of n = 444) were employed outside academia, primarily by private sector organisations. This is a strong indicator of what we&amp;rsquo;ve known anecdotally for a while - that R, a language originally designed and used in academia, is becoming more prevalent outside that context. At the same time, this may be a (somewhat) localised effect: while the language is increasingly popular, the technology industry centred on Silicon Valley is certainly an outlier in many respects for research overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png&#34; title=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting takeaway was that men are more likely to work in industry and permanent academic jobs than women - and women are far, &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more likely to be students. Again, this isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising since it fits the pattern that women attending tend to be younger than men, and overall patterns that the tech industry (which is where one would expect the majority of privately-employed R programmers and scientists to work) has a known problem with employing and promoting women, as does academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all attendees work full-time. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to tell if this is due to the wider community largely being employed or engaged in full-time activities, or due to the cost of attendance diminishing the ability of community members in more economically fragile situations such as part-time work or unemployment to attend. Female attendees were less likely to work part-time, and far more likely to identify their status as unemployed (although the sample size is too small to really draw conclusions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Employment Status&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Women (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Men (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Full-time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;92.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;94.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Part-time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;1.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;4.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;I am not currently employed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;6.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;1.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion identifying as unemployed is greater than the proportion that previously identified as unemployed or retired, which could indicate that some students are categorising themselves as &amp;lsquo;not in employment&amp;rsquo; when not presented with an option that reflects student-status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;caregiving&#34;&gt;Caregiving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately a quarter of respondents answered &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to the question &amp;ldquo;are you a caregiver for children or adult dependents on a regular basis?&amp;rdquo; (n = 445). More men than women identified as caregivers. This either indicates that R programmers are a singularly socially enlightened population, or reflects wider sociological conditioning around caregiving which makes it easier for men to leave children at home with their partner (if applicable) than for women to do the same - resulting in a self-selection effect in which women with children are less likely to be able to attend (and so women who do attend are less likely to have children they care for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative data suggests, unsurprisingly, the latter - in the free-text field for the survey, several (female) respondents mentioned the difficulty of persuading their (male) partners to handle childcare to allow them to attend conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Caregiving Status&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Women (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Men (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;78.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;71.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;21.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;28.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recommendations&#34;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conference-proposals&#34;&gt;Conference proposals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey data surfaces a lot of problems that can be tackled directly by future useR! conferences, and other conferences in the field too. In particular, it shows that while the gender breakdown of the conference is not as bad as we might fear, it&amp;rsquo;s still lagging behind the general population of the scientific fields R programming draws from, as well as the population as a whole. In addition, and in some ways more worryingly, attendees are overwhelmingly white, with Native Americans, Latinx people and people of African descent particularly under-represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems won&amp;rsquo;t be solved overnight, but there are several things the conference can do that would make attending a more viable and enjoyable prospect for under-represented groups. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wider scholarship system&lt;/em&gt;. useR! 2016 featured scholarships, helping pay for things like plane tickets or hotels for people from marginalised backgrounds who wished to attend. The committee tasked with allotting the money did excellent work, but the money available was small. Expanding the scholarship fund in future conferences would let more under-represented R programmers attend, going a long way towards making a more representative conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Childcare and feeding support&lt;/em&gt;. One of the things we saw in qualitative data, and something the quantitative data points to, is that the difficulties of juggling childcare is a blocker on attendance, particularly for women. Providing subsidised or free childcare at the conference itself (along with breastfeeding rooms), and incorporating childcare into the scholarship system, would help with this, and has been successfully done elsewhere.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staggered ticket release&lt;/em&gt;. useR! 2016 sold out incredibly quickly, with all of the tickets gone within a day. This made it difficult for people to attend if they weren&amp;rsquo;t extremely on the ball and able to decide, on or before the first registration day, that they wanted to attend. By definition this hurts marginalised people because it hurts people who, for financial reasons, need to put some energy behind working out if they can attend. One solution worth considering is staggering the release of tickets over several days or weeks - perhaps with a waiting or notification list. This offers potential attendees multiple opportunities, reducing the penalty paid for not being ready to go on day 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;more precise code of conduct&lt;/em&gt;. Following an open letter in 2015 the R Foundation adopted a resolution that any Foundation-affiliated conference have a Code of Conduct,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which we applaud. What that code contains, however, in terms of restrictions, the amount of information given to attendees, and the enforcement mechanisms and their ease of use, is largely left up to the individual conference instance. This creates inconsistency and uncertainty for both attendees and conference organisers. Selecting a specific code of conduct, with a specific enforcement mechanism, along with training for enforcers, would solve for much of this, and give concerned attendees more certainty that the conference is a safe place to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;task-force-proposals&#34;&gt;Task Force proposals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey has also helped to shape the goals of the Task Force on Women in the R Community. In particular, focusing in women, as a catchall, is not enough. Issues such as race, sexuality, disability and class intersect with gender and must also be considered if we are to build an R community that is more representative of the scientific/software communities and of society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly we are rebranding the Task Force as simply Forwards, so that we can consider the needs of other marginalised groups as part of our mission. Our primary focus will still be on women as there remains much work to do here and broadening participation of women was the motivation for setting up the task force. However many of the practical actions we can take, such as the proposals above, will also impact other marginalised groups and making this impact a formal part of our mission will help to ensure our actions do not only benefit white, highly educated women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an immediate consequence, we will be publishing an open call for participation, seeking more members for the group. We are particularly interested in talking to volunteers from non-White, LGBT, non-middle-class or early career backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this survey has also served to reinforce that we have no fundamental ground truth here; it is hard to see what the backgrounds of those who try but fail to attend useR are, and their reasons for not going - it is hard to see what the demographics of R community members overall look like. Accordingly we will be running further surveys, adjusting several questions to factor in things we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from running this one, looking at the overall community and useR! attendees in a more nuanced way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company would like to sponsor diversity scholarships or childcare at useR! 2017, please contact the chair of the local organizing committee, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto: tobias.verbeke@openanalytics.eu&#34;&gt;Tobias Verbeke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not plan to release the raw survey data as many individuals can be uniquely identified from one or two demographic questions. We may release the data in an aggregated form once we have completed our full analysis (this post covers the first of three sections).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis presented here used the following packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For data manipulation: dplyr, forcats, maptools, matrixStats, tidyr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For visualisaton and reporting: knitr, ggplot2, mapproj, RColorBrewer, rworldmap,
scales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/forwards/surveys-public/blog-posts/useR-2016/mapping-users/mapping-users.Rmd&#34;&gt;Rmarkdown file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
