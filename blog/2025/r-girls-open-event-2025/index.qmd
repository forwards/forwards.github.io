Forwards members Heather Turner and Ella Kaye were invited to attend the 
"Data Science for Girls" open event hosted by 
[R-Girls](https://greenoak.bham.sch.uk/r-girls-school-network/) at 
[Green Oak Academy](https://greenoak.bham.sch.uk/), Birmingham, UK on 
July 9 2025. They joined other guests from [Ascent](https://www.ascent.io/) 
and [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/about-us/) to 
find out how students at this girls' school have been using R.

Below Heather and Ella report on this event.

## Website Presentations

The day started with an assembly of Years 7-9 (ages 11-14, around 50 students), 
the school teachers and guests. Students from Years 8 and 9 (age 12-14) 
presented websites they had created with 
[Distill](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill/) as part of their Year 8 IT 
lessons. 

The girls had worked in small groups to design a website for a fantasy 
online shop. This allowed a lot of creativity in designing logos, selecting 
photos and writing marketing content. The students revealed their love of 
makeup, fashion, animals, and more. Some highlights for us were a sweet treat 
shop (very professional-looking!), a site about snow leopards (presented with 
great humour!), and a shop promoting Afghani fashion (beautiful photos!).

Each group gave a short speech and with a live demo. We were impressed 
that the girls had got to grips with GitHub as well as editing the R markdown 
source.

## Computer Practical

After a break, we joined a lesson being taught by Anisa Nawaz to 
Year 7 students. It was only their second lesson using R and they were 
learning how to create sequences with `seq()`, working in an R markdown 
template.

Along with other guests, we assisted by helping the 
students to trouble-shoot issues. Understanding how to generate decreasing 
sequences with a negative `by` argument required a bit of thinking, while 
breaking R markdown chunks by typing code in the wrong place caused some 
practical issues. But the girls did well!

## Summary

Overall, we were happy to see the enthusiasm from both staff and students
in using R to support the girls' studies. There is a lot of pride in this 
activity, as demonstrated by the display that greets you when you walk in:

On the board, a display with a flowery border, titled 'R-Girls Schools Network', followed by the pink R Girls logo. The display has examples of code and graphs, plus large text boxes with information.}
Hopefully this experience gives the girls a positive view about using R or 
other languages, that they can build on in the future.
