R Dev Days are events for novice and experienced contributors to 
collaborate on contributions to the code, documentation and translations in 
base R. There are several planned in the coming months with 
application/registration deadlines in the next couple of weeks - don't miss out!

There may be further events later in the year - for the latest information, see 
the [R Dev Days](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/r-dev-days/) page on 
the R Contributors website. R Dev Days are also publicised on the 
[R-devel mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel), the 
R Contributor [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@R_Contributors), 
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/R-Contributors.hachyderm.io.ap.brid.gy) and 
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/R-Contributors/)
accounts, and the 
[R Foundation LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-r-foundation-for-statistical-computing/)!

## How do R Dev Days work?

Tasks are prepared in the run-up to the event, where external contribution is 
welcome and good progress can be made in a day. Often this will be
reviewing, analysing and/or fixing code or documentation bugs reported on R’s 
[Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org), or translating message strings from 
English to other languages via
[Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/). You can see 
examples of tasks on the [r-dev-day repo](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues).

Participants express interest in tasks prior to the event or at the start of 
the day. This helps to allocate people into small groups that work on one or 
two issues for the rest of the day. At the end of the day, the groups report 
progress on their task and any next steps required.

## Are R Dev Days for you?

R Dev Days are aimed at people with a good knowledge of R programming that 
are keen to contribute back to the core codebase. Most participants will be 
comfortable writing and debugging R functions, writing help pages and using 
version control. Further expertise, such as competency in C programming or 
advanced knowledge of statistical methods, can certainly be useful, but is not 
necessary for all tasks.

Part of the objective is to foster a more diverse community of contributors, 
so anyone that identifies as part of an underrepresented group is 
particularly encouraged to apply!
