Forwards Blog
=======================

***Hi Micheál, nice to meet you! Tell us a bit about yourself.***

Hi, I am a Deaf software engineer in Ireland. I am experienced in automated tests with Selenium, Cucumber and a couple of OOP languages. During my free time, I am volunteering for Deaf community with various roles such as secretary, treasurer, social media and fundraising. Deaf community and I are currently campaigning for the recognition of Irish Sign Language (ISL) as Ireland’s third official language and the ratification of UN Convention of the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). 

I am recently elected to the board of Python Ireland, with my personal aim of making Dublin’s monthly meetups and an annual conference, PyCon Ireland more accessible for Deaf software engineers. It is where I first met Forwards’ Kevin O’Brien and he introduced me to the important taskforce. 

***Are you a data scientist?***

No, I’m a test automation engineer. 

***Do you go to tech meetups?***

Like many Deaf people, I don’t attend any of tech meetups, except PyCon 2016. It would be so daunting and much effort in attending tech meetups. If we want to go, we would have to book our places and then asking for sign language interpreters. Since there is no public funding in Ireland for providing interpreters at social events, it would be difficult to expect some organisations in paying for the interpreters or captioning services.

That was the main reason why I got involved with Python Ireland, to have it being proactive and accessible to Deaf software engineers. 

***Is there a big tech community in the Deaf community?***

There are some Deaf software engineers but there was no place or organisation for us to meet up. So, I recently set up a Facebook group, Deaf Software Engineers Ireland, and we have 14 members. I am looking for more Deaf software engineers to get in touch with. The members in the group will be encouraged in sharing information on any events, training or workshops that have sign language interpreters or captioning.

***How can we make workplaces and classrooms more accessible and inclusive for Deaf software engineers?***

In an ideal world, everyone could use sign language, either with a Deaf or hearing person. With sign language, we are well able to express ideas and sharing experiences, without any restriction. Sign language is so natural and empowering and it would allow us to have an equal part of our inclusive society. 

However, it’s very different outside the signing environment. 95% of Deaf children do not have access to education in their preferred language. Deaf people are 10 times less likely to attend university and they are 2-4 times more likely to be unemployed than their hearing peers. 

We are campaigning to recognise ISL as Ireland’s official language and there are some great examples around the world that we would love to see them implemented in Ireland. UK’s Access to Work scheme and Finland’s interpreting voucher system are two best examples. Both governments would fund for interpreters at workplaces, rather than expecting small businesses and startups to spend on them. 

I hope we will have you as our growing number of allies in fighting for the recognition of ISL, pushing for the ratification of UNCRPD and making workplaces and classrooms more accessible and inclusive for Deaf people.
