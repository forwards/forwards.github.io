## Background

The task force was set up by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) in December 2015 to address the underrepresentation of women among contributors to the R
project and in the R community more generally.

The members of the task force were invited to participate based on their 
interest in addressing the gender imbalance and their contributions in this 
area, as well as to give a reasonable balance of different genders, different
geographic regions, different work contexts, different career stages and 
different aspects of the R project (e.g. CRAN and Bioconductor).

The task force is happy to engage with other individuals and organisations (such
as [R-ladies](http://r-ladies.org)) that are concerned about this issue and 
actively seeks outside contributions on specific tasks.
