## Background

The task force was set up by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) in December 2015 to address the underrepresentation of women and rebranded in January 2017 to accommodate more under-represented groups such as LGBT, minority ethnic groups, and people with disabilities in the R community.

The members of the task force were invited to participate based on their interest in routing for specific under-represented groups and their contributions in the area of diversity and inclusion, to reflect different genders, ethnic groups, work contexts, career stages and aspects of the R project (e.g. CRAN and Bioconductor). The task force focuses on particular tasks as outlined below:

- **Accessibility**: Working to improve access to R materials for people with low vision, blindness, hard of hearing, deaf, and other disabilities.

- **Community**: General outreach to help people from under-represented groups get into R and develop as useRs.

- **Conferences**: Focusing on R Foundation conferences, liaising with organizers/program committee on policies and inclusion initiatives.

- **On-ramps**: Creating paths for useRs to develop their skills and make contributions to the R/BioConductor package ecosystem.

- **Social Media**: Posting to Mastodon (bridged to Bluesky) and LinkedIn, soliciting blog posts and publishing them, maintaining website.

- **Surveys**: Running and analysing community surveys, packaging up data and tools and maintaining the [Data](https://forwards.github.io/data/) page.

- **Teaching**: Methodology, materials and workshops designed for under-represented groups.


The activities of the taskforce are recorded in the [minutes of our team meetings](https://github.com/forwards/meetings-public). We are open to new members - if interested, please contact rowforwards@gmail.com.

Forwards is happy to engage with other individuals and organisations (such as [R-Ladies](http://r-ladies.org/)) that are concerned about diversity and inclusion and actively seek outside collaboration on specific tasks.
