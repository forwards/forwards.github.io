<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The task force was set up by the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/foundation/">R Foundation</a> in December 2015 to address the underrepresentation of women among contributors to the R project and in the R community more generally.</p>
<p>The members of the task force were invited to participate based on their interest in addressing the gender imbalance and their contributions in this area, as well as to give a reasonable balance of different genders, different geographic regions, different work contexts, different career stages and different aspects of the R project (e.g.Â CRAN and Bioconductor).</p>
<p>The task force is happy to engage with other individuals and organisations (such as <a href="http://r-ladies.org">R-ladies</a>) that are concerned about this issue and actively seeks outside contributions on specific tasks.</p>
